          As founder of the company, I want to rebuild my Busmall around the communities request. I want to customize my stocks, based on what the consumers waant and need. I would be delighted if you could take the time to comlete my inventory survey and help build a mall custom to your requests. When you are finished, you will have the chance to win one of these products as a personal thanks from me to you. Thank you!
